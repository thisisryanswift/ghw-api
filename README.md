# ghw-api

This was a quick, live workshop I made for [Global Hack Week: APIs](https://ghw.mlh.io/events/api-week). During this workshop, I wanted to showcase how to use Python and Flask to make a dead simple API yourself. You can watch the VOD here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRLI1oocP34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRLI1oocP34)
